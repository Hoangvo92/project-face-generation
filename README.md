# project-face-generation
This is a project for UDACITY Machine Learning Course
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how it performs.

Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

	git clone https://github.com/Hoangvo92/project-face-generation.git
	cd dog-classification-project
Create a new conda environment: ... conda create --name deep-learning python=3 ... Enter your new environment:

  Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning
  Windows: >> activate deep-learning
Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following: ... conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook ... Install torchvision: https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchvision ... conda install -c pytorch torchvision ...

Run the following to open up the notebook server:

 jupyter notebook
 
 You can run all the cells of code after download the dataset or using your own suitable processed data. The download link for the dataset is in the notebook file.
 Overall, I could complete this project thanks to Udacity lectures about GAN, CycleGAN, and hyperparameters.
